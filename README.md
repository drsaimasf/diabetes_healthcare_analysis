## Project Overview

Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide and early detection is essential for effective prevention and treatment. This project analyzes clinical healthcare data and develops a machine learning model to predict diabetes risk based on patient health indicators.

This project demonstrates practical healthcare data analytics and predictive modeling skills applicable to hospital analytics, clinical decision support, and public health.

## Objectives

- Perform healthcare data cleaning and preprocessing
- Analyze patient clinical features
- Identify risk factors associated with diabetes
- Build a machine learning model to predict diabetes risk
- Evaluate model performance using healthcare data

---

## Dataset Description

Dataset: Diabetes Clinical Dataset

The dataset includes patient health indicators such as:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin level
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age
- Diabetes outcome (target variable)

This dataset simulates real-world clinical healthcare data used in predictive analytics.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Healthcare Data Analysis

The following analysis was performed:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature distribution analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Healthcare data visualization

This helps identify patterns and relationships between clinical variables and diabetes risk.

## Machine Learning Model

Algorithm used:

- Random Forest Classifier

Steps performed:

- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Train-test split
- Model training
- Model prediction
- Model evaluation

---

## Results

The Random Forest machine learning model achieved strong predictive performance in identifying patients at risk of diabetes.

Example result:

- Model Accuracy: ~75% to 85% (depending on training split)

This demonstrates that machine learning can effectively predict diabetes risk using clinical healthcare data.
